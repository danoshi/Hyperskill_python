<h2>10 puppies</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>You want your program to work in a way that at any given time there can be <strong>no more than</strong> 10 puppies. Define <code class="java">__new__</code> method so that this restriction is placed on the class.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Pay attention to the comparison symbols that you use. If there are already 10 puppies (10 instances of the class <code class="java">Puppy</code>), you should NOT be able to create another one!</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
